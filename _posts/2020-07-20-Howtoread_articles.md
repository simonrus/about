# What shall be saved to Zotero

I use Zotero to track papers. Here is what I keep as notes about  read article:

1. Article coverage (e.g. I understood 50%)
2. Background expressed in 5-7 sentences
3. A list of ideas, that came during reading
4. A list of ideas, that came during reading
5. Identify an issue and specific questions
6. Important references (what to read next and why!)
