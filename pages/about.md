Hi! I am Software engineer living in Germany near Nürnberg. 

In 2001 I finished Saint Petersburg Lyceum 30 that specializes in mathematics and physics. In 2006 I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University of Aerospace instrumentation with MSc-level degree in Information System Security. My diploma thesis was “The performance of networks protocols in wireless channels”. 

Since 2006 I worked in many companies, mostly in the telecommunication area. I was focused mostly on simulations and software development for LTE/5G (PHY and MAC for UE and e/gNodeB, traffic optimizing solutions, virtual prototyping).In addition to telecommunication experience I completed several projects in the area of heterogeneous parallel computing, audio recognition, high performance digital signal processing on GPU.

Currently, I am working on developing C-V2X products. In a spare time, I do hobby research about how to use TPU to accelerate decoding or speed-up simulations of error-correcting codes.
