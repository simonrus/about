Hi! I am Software engineer living in Germany near Nürnberg
I was born on 11.04.1984 in USSR, Tashkent

In 2001 I finished Saintasd Petersburg Lyceum 30 that specializes in mathematics and physics. In 2006 I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University of Aerospace instrumentation with MSc-level degree in Information System Security. My diploma thesis was “The performance of networks protocols in wireless channels”. 

Since 2006 I worked in different companies in the telecommunication area focused on simulations and software development for LTE/5G L1 (UE and e/gNodeB, traffic optimizing solutions, virtual prototyping)
In addition to telecommunication experience I worked with heterogeneous parallel computing, audio recognition, high performance parallel digital signal processing.

Currently, I am working on developing C-V2X products. In a spare time, I do hobby research about how to use TPU to accelerate decoding or simulations of error-correcting codes
